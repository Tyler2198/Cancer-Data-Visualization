# 🎯 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning 🚀

This project demonstrates the use of Random Forests and other machine learning techniques to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the well-known breast cancer dataset. The project includes data exploration, visualizations, and model evaluation to deliver accurate and interpretable results.

# 📝 Overview
Breast cancer diagnosis is a critical medical challenge, and this project leverages machine learning to improve classification accuracy. The dataset contains features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses, describing characteristics of cell nuclei.
